# Commentary
- For this task, in order to collect data, I had to put together my final major project prototype. Since it is a product in development, I wanted to see how the "users" feel about it
and what their feedback would be in order to get the final product as accesible as possible. I have setup Unity and Fmod and started working.
- After I have managed to implement the Fmod event, I have created a script that takes the user straight to the survey after pressing the stop button in the editor. This is due to my
project not having an "Exit" or "End" button so I had to adapt.
- The feedback was collected via Google Forms. I have created a new form with three different sections. Each section contains different questions that allow the user to either answer
briefly or choose between options. I have chosen this format to give the freedom of speech but also get a chart based on the options. This will allow me to add features the users would
like to see and further improve my project. To make sure every tester is on board with their data being collected and further used for the development of this project, I have put the
first question "I consent to my gameplay data and feedback being used for this university project." with "Yes" or "No" options. Everyone that has participated, have given their consent.
- The data logged was focused more on what the users are looking for in my game rather than performance. I have considered this format to be the most optimal since my project is about
creating a more "user-friendly" environment for people to mix or transition songss than Spotify's mixing option.
