- To collect data for this task, I first had to build a working version, or prototype, of my final product. Since the product is still in development, my main goal was to see how users felt about it and get helpful feedback. This feedback will ensure the final version is as easy to use as possible. I started by linking Unity with FMOD to get the sound working.
- After I successfully got the sound working with FMOD, I hit a problem: my prototype doesn't have an "Exit" or "End Game" button. To fix this and smoothly move users to the survey, I wrote a quick script. This script automatically opens the survey link right after the user hits the stop button in the Unity Editor. This was a necessary change to make sure people filled out the form while their experience was fresh in their mind.
- I collected all the feedback using Google Forms, which I organized into three main parts. I made sure the questions were a mix of simple choices (like checkboxes, which help me create charts) and open questions (where users can write whatever they think). This mix helps me get quick numbers and also lets users fully explain their ideas. Ethics were very important; I started the form with a consent question to make sure everyone was happy for their data to be used. All participants agreed to the statement: "I consent to my gameplay data and feedback being used for this university project."
- I focused my data collection on what users wanted and what features they looked for, not just how fast the program ran. This focus is important because the whole point of my project is to create a much better, user-friendly environment for mixing and transitioning songs than the simple crossfading you find on Spotify. The three survey sections gave me plenty of information. The feedback showed some limits, like one user saying, "music was ok, the speakers on the laptop did not give it justice, I would suggest a remix and some ideas of different interactions."
- Most importantly, users asked for better design and more ways to interact. They specifically requested "More buttons and sliders," and "More interactivity and thought behind the UI design, like slider for slider values and switches." I asked for honest criticism because I need to know what to fix, not just what I got right. These very honest answers give me a clear, user-focused plan for the next stage of development, ensuring I have a specific goal in mind.
